<h1 class="head2"> About The Website </h1>

<p class="p2"> The 'End Gun Violence' Website was designed for the SOWCoders CWB
  2021 Program. The purpose for this website is to not only provide information
  but to also provide resources for aid. We are based in Belize, which is another
  reason why this website is so important. We hope you like our website and it
  can be of use to you.
  <br>
  Our Mission Statement is "Enough Silence, Let's End Gun Violence."
  <br>
   Thank you!
